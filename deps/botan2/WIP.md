# WIP build
The current conanfile builds botan 3.4, which is the latest at the time of writing.
__This is not yet tested with IncludeOS__. The last version known to work with IncludeOS is botan 2.8, which had explicit support. The approach now is to see if we can avoid requiring special support and use a linux build.
