# Test basics of C++ Standard Template Library
This just tests a fraction of STL functionality, but it's here to just verify that basic STL support is in place and working. Useful i.e. when working on porting STL or switching implementation (e.g. to EASTL)

Sucess: Outputs SUCCESS if all tests pass
Fail: Panic if any test fails

NOTE: This test uses the `lest` unit test framework as well for some tests. The result of those tests will also be reported.
