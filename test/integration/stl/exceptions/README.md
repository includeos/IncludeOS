# Test exceptions

Exceptions are usually taken for granted, but they require proper unwinding, which is not itself a part of the standard C++ library.

These tests are internal only, so just running `test.sh` should be enough, and the output will be self explanatory.

Sucess: Outputs SUCCESS if all tests pass
Fail: Panic if any test fails
