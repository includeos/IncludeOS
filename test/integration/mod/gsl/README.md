# Test basics of C++ Core Guidelines Support Library
This just tests a fraction of GSL functionality, but it's here to just verify that basic GSL support is in place and working in IncludeOS.

Sucess: Outputs SUCCESS if all tests pass
Fail: Panic if any test fails

NOTE: This test uses the `lest` unit test framework as well for some tests. The result of those tests will also be reported.
